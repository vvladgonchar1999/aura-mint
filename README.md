#  Aura Mint — Capture the Vibe

Welcome to **Aura Mint**, a fresh and emotional take on NFTs. This project is being built with love, creativity, and some caffeine for the [🛠 hackathon we're participating in]!

##  What's Aura Mint?

In the fast-paced world of Web3, we're missing something...  
**Feelings. Energy. Vibes.**

**Aura Mint** lets you mint a unique NFT that captures the *vibe* of a moment — a mood, a phrase, an energy, or a message you want to lock forever on the blockchain.

###  Use Cases
- **Group chats**: Capture the energy of a legendary moment.
- **Events**: Mint the collective vibe of a meetup or a moment.
- **Creators**: Drop personal moods as limited edition tokens.

## 🎉 Made for the Hackathon

We’re building **Aura Mint** as part of a Web3 / Solana hackathon.  
The goal? Ship something bold, emotional, and usable. Not just another PFP project.

We believe Web3 should feel human. And that’s what we’re trying to mint into the chain.
